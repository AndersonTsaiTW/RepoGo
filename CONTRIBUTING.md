## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. Please be respectful and considerate in your interactions with others.

**Key principles:**
- Be welcoming and inclusive
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go 1.22 or higher**: [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Make** (optional but recommended): For using the Makefile
  - Windows: `choco install make` or `scoop install make`
  - macOS: Already included with Xcode Command Line Tools
  - Linux: `apt-get install build-essential` or equivalent

### Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RepoGo.git
   cd RepoGo
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/AndersonTsaiTW/RepoGo.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Build the Project

```bash
# Using make
make build

# Or using go directly
go build -o bin/repogo ./cmd/repogo
```

### Run the Application

```bash
# Scan current directory
./bin/repogo

# Show help
./bin/repogo --help

# Scan with options
./bin/repogo . -o output.md --include "*.go,*.md"
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests for specific package
go test ./internal/scanner/
```

**Testing Policy:**
- Tests are **encouraged but not required** for contributions
- For **bug fixes**, please include a test that reproduces the issue
- We provide example tests in `internal/analyzer/analyzer_test.go` to help you get started
- Go's testing is simple - just create a `*_test.go` file next to your code!

## How to Contribute

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/AndersonTsaiTW/RepoGo/issues) for something to work on
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- If you have a new idea, create an issue first to discuss it

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the code style guidelines (see below)
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "type: brief description"
```

See [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines) for details.

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style

We follow standard Go conventions:

- **Use `gofmt`**: Format your code with `gofmt` before committing
  ```bash
  gofmt -w .
  ```

- **Run `go vet`**: Check for common mistakes
  ```bash
  go vet ./...
  ```

- **Follow Go best practices**:
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Keep functions small and focused
  - Add comments for exported functions and types
  - Use package-level documentation

### Package Organization

Our project structure:

```
cmd/repogo/          # Application entry point
internal/            # Internal packages (not importable by other projects)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/         # Data structures
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/         # Configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scanner/        # File scanning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git/            # Git integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyzer/       # File analysis
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ renderer/       # Output rendering
```

**Guidelines:**
- Each package should have a single, well-defined purpose
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Use `internal/` for code that shouldn't be imported externally
- Add package-level comments explaining the package purpose

### Documentation

- **Public functions and types** must have comments
  ```go
  // GetInfo retrieves Git repository information from the specified root directory.
  // Returns nil if the directory is not a Git repository.
  func GetInfo(root string) (*models.GitInfo, error) {
      // ...
  }
  ```

- **Package documentation**: Add a `doc.go` or package comment
  ```go
  // Package scanner provides file system scanning and filtering functionality.
  package scanner
  ```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (updating dependencies, etc.)

### Examples

```
feat(scanner): add support for .gitignore patterns

Implement gitignore pattern matching to automatically exclude
files that are in .gitignore.

Closes #42
```

```
fix(analyzer): correct token estimation for multi-byte characters

The previous implementation incorrectly counted bytes instead of
characters, leading to inaccurate token estimates for non-ASCII text.

Fixes #38
```

```
docs: update README with new CLI options
```

### Rules

- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Start lowercase, no period at the end
- Keep it short and clear
- Reference issues: `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`

## Pull Request Process
